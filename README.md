-learnt the pseudo class ::before and ::after
-learnt the importance of position relative , absolute and fixed in a web page
-know that i need to learn ui design
-learnt how to change svg colors based on screen size

after this project go back to section 2, 3 and 4 and work on the sticky nav on scrollbars

- i just realized this today images should always be 100% but their width should be controlled using a parent element that means that images in html should always be wraped inside a parent element

- just learnt that u can actulay use css to add quotes to a html using CSS

```html
<h1 class="quote">this will have a quote</h1>
```

```css
.quote {
  quotes: " ' " " ' ";
}
```
